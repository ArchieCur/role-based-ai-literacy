# Role-Based AI Literacy Framework

> AI literacy isn't a single subjectâ€”it's a spectrum of role-specific competencies.

## The Problem

Organizations are approaching AI literacy training as if everyone needs the same foundational knowledge. The result? Generic "AI 101" workshops, overwhelming catalogs of disconnected modules, and frustrated learners who can't find what they actually need for their jobs.

**The reality:** A Business Leader doesn't need to understand neural network architectures. A Data Scientist doesn't need generic "cloud strategy" overviews. A K-12 Educator doesn't need certification prep courses.

**What's missing:** A framework that maps AI literacy needs to specific professional roles at a granular, actionable level.

## The Solution

This repository contains a **role-based AI literacy framework** that demonstrates how AI literacy requirements differ dramatically across 30 professional rolesâ€”even at the beginner level.

Instead of asking *"What is AI literacy?"* we ask: *"What AI literacy does this specific role need?"*

### Framework Structure

The framework uses four competency levels aligned with established academic frameworks (EU/OECD AILit, Barnard College, Stanford):

- **(A) Awareness** - Understanding that AI exists, basic concepts, where it's used
- **(B) Application** - Using AI tools effectively in your work, evaluating outputs  
- **(C) Integration** - Managing AI within workflows, making strategic decisions about AI adoption
- **(E) Ethics** - Risk awareness, bias, privacy, responsible use (present at ALL levels)

Each of the 30 roles is mapped to 3-5 specific competencies based on:
- How they interact with AI (consumer, implementer, decision-maker, governor)
- What decisions they make about AI (technical, strategic, pedagogical, ethical)
- The consequences of AI misuse in their role
- The appropriate level of technical depth

## What's Included

### ðŸ“Š Core Framework
- **Role-Based AI Literacy Framework (Excel)** - Visual chart showing all 30 roles and their beginner-level competencies
- **Methodology Document (Word)** - Detailed explanation of the framework's development, design principles, and implementation recommendations

### ðŸ“‹ Practical Governance Tools
Three pre-adoption frameworks for organizational AI governance:
- **Agentic AI Practical Governance Framework** - Risk assessment, decision trees, governance structures
- **Agentic AI Realistic Expectations Guide** - Capabilities, limitations, when to use traditional automation
- **Agentic AI Vendor Evaluation Checklist** - Technical assessment, security, compliance, ROI evaluation

## Key Insights

After mapping 30 roles, clear patterns emerged:

### Technical Implementers (Engineers, Developers)
- Heavy emphasis on **(B) Application** competencies
- Need hands-on integration skills
- Ethics focus: Technical considerations (security, privacy, reliability)

### Business & Strategic Roles (Leaders, Managers)
- Heavy emphasis on **(C) Integration** competencies  
- Need conceptual understanding without deep technical detail
- Ethics focus: Strategic risk (compliance, brand reputation)

### Educators (K-12, Higher Ed, School Leaders)
- Unique blend: Must USE AI (B) AND teach about it
- Strong ethics focus around student welfare
- Need pedagogical application skills

### Governance & Risk Roles (Auditors, Privacy Managers)
- Heavy **(E) Ethics** emphasisâ€”this is their core work
- Need assessment and evaluation skills
- Must understand enough to govern effectively

### Data Professionals (Analysts, Engineers, Scientists)
- Progressive technical depth across roles
- All need data ethics as foundational
- Focus on data as fuel for AI systems

## Background & Context

This framework emerged from 18 months of hands-on experience training users during enterprise Copilot rollouts (2023-2025), specifically in:
- Dynamics CRM
- Finance and Operations  
- Office productivity platforms

**What I learned:** Generic AI training fails because it treats AI literacy as universal knowledge rather than contextual expertise. Users need training that matches their role, not another lecture on what transformers are.

**What I built:** A practical framework that organizations can use immediately to design targeted, actionable AI literacy programs.

## How to Use This Framework

### For Organizations
1. Map your workforce to the 30 roles (or similar categories)
2. Use the competency framework to create role-specific learning paths
3. Prioritize beginner-level literacy across all roles before investing in advanced training
4. Supplement vendor training with strategic, decision-making content

### For Training Developers
1. Use the A/B/C/E taxonomy to create reusable content blocks
2. Develop role-specific scenarios and examples
3. Create "choose your own adventure" learning paths where users select their role

### For Individuals
1. Find your role in the framework
2. Focus on those specific competencies first
3. As you grow, explore competencies for adjacent roles to understand collaboration points

## Limitations & Future Work

**Current Scope:**
- Beginner level only (intermediate and advanced progressions to come)
- 30 roles as sample, not comprehensive coverage
- Some role overlap exists (e.g., Business Leader vs. Business Owner)

**Future Development:**
- Expand to intermediate and advanced competency levels
- Add industry-specific variations (healthcare, financial services, etc.)
- Create assessment tools to measure competency achievement
- Develop role transition maps
- Partner with training providers to create actual curriculum

## Contributing

This framework is shared freely in the spirit of advancing AI literacy for everyone. If you:
- Have feedback on the competencies
- Want to add roles or expand to intermediate/advanced levels
- Have practical insights from implementing this in your organization
- Want to develop training content based on this framework

Please open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's build this together.

## Acknowledgments

This framework was developed in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic AI), synthesizing insights from:
- EU/OECD AI Literacy Framework (AILit)
- Barnard College AI Literacy Framework
- Stanford Teaching Commons AI Literacy Framework

The irony that an AI tool helped create a framework for teaching humans about AI is not lost on us. It reinforces a key insight: AI should be used to solve AI-related problems, including the challenge of AI literacy itself.

## About

This framework represents practical expertise from the frontlines of enterprise AI adoption. It's built on the belief that effective AI literacy training must be:
- Role-specific, not generic
- Action-oriented, not theoretical  
- Immediately applicable, not aspirational
- Honest about limitations, not just promotional

If you're fumbling with AI training rollouts, overwhelmed by vendor training catalogs, or wondering why "AI literacy" initiatives aren't workingâ€”this framework is for you.
